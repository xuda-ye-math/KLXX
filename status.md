# Project status

Last updated: 2026-07-11T14:13:38-04:00 (America/New_York)

## Current state

- Repository: `/mnt/projects/X-regularization`
- Branch: `main`, tracking `origin/main`. HEAD before the requested BCP is `0e08b01af19071a1787a28aac534f21cf80bd512` — `Rebuild molecular benchmark and freeze jflows_md plan`.
- Worktree before this status edit: no staged paths, 2 modified tracked paths, 14 tracked deletions, and 88 individual untracked files. This status edit adds `status.md` as a third modified tracked path. All current changes are in `Molecular_BG/` plus this status record; no unrelated user work is mixed into the milestone.
- **Done — `jflows_md` core:** the public facade, verified bundle loader, pure-JAX Amber bonded/nonbonded/OBC1/ACE force field, mixed BAT coordinate chart, exact coordinate Jacobian, ADP L-only half-chart, Gaussian × torus source, torus-correct MALA, and potential-space SMC are implemented under `Molecular_BG/jflows_md/`. Low-level implementation remains confined to `jflows_md/core/`.
- The copied `Molecular_BG/jflows/` source remains byte-identical to `/mnt/projects/jflows/jflows/` at commit `fcee81c432d95cb4d841a14605e133b54d08c84d`; no compatibility edit was made to the base package.
- Three immutable runtime bundles are complete: FAB L-ADP uses Amber ff96/OBC1 on `R^42 × T^18` (60D); glycerol uses GAFF2/AM1-BCC/OBC1 on `R^25 × T^11` (36D); explicitly neutral diethanolamine uses GAFF2/AM1-BCC/OBC1 on `R^33 × T^15` (48D). All use 300 K, mbondi2 radii, ACE, dielectric 1.0/78.5, zero salt, `NoCutoff`, and no constraints.
- Runtime input is now only the selected complete directory under `Molecular_BG/bundles/`; no asset, trajectory, reference-sample, PDB-only, or legacy-data lookup occurs. `bundles/build_molecular_bundles.py` stages canonical seeds already frozen inside each bundle and rebuilt all three bundles in place with all 25 scientific payload files byte-identical.
- Verification: `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false ~/.envs/jax/bin/python Molecular_BG/smoke/run_all.py` passed on the GPU. Maximum stored-OpenMM/JAX energy discrepancy was `5.04e-8 kJ/mol`; maximum force RMSE was `4.48e-8 kJ/mol/nm`. Coordinate/Jacobian round trips, finite JIT gradients, ADP chirality, small-molecule parity support, mixed MALA, and a two-rung SMC bridge all passed.
- `Molecular_BG/` has the intentionally minimal top-level layout: `bundles/`, `jflows/`, `jflows_md/`, `reference/`, `smoke/`, `README.md`, and `JFLOWS_MD_PLAN.md`. The former `assets/`, `data/`, `docs/`, `src/`, and `tools/` trees were deliberately removed after a verified mirror backup.
- The FAB reference is evaluation-only: `reference/adp_truth.png` is the one-million-frame 100 × 100 ground-truth histogram. Recovery-critical `reference/fab_train.h5` and derived `reference/fab_train_phi_psi.npz` remain local and are intentionally ignored by Git through the global `*.h5` and `*.npz` rules; the mirror backup includes ignored files.
- The prior paper and `Codes/` evidence state is unchanged by this molecular milestone. `Molecular_BG_1/` remains the historical paper-era PyTorch tree, and `Molecular_BG_2/zflows_md/` remains a read-only repair/design reference.

## Pending

- **Pending — next major task:** implement identity-initialized mixed spline couplings with ordinary RQS on Euclidean coordinates and circular C1 RQS on torsions, without changing the completed potential/coordinate core or treating the full box as periodic.
- **Pending:** train the first Boltzmann generator against the exact ADP bundle using MALA and optimizer-only finite-safe `e_clip`; retain honest unclipped target values for MCMC, SMC, ESS, and evaluation, and do not restore sharpening.
- **Pending:** establish training/evaluation ladders and matched reference diagnostics for glycerol and neutral diethanolamine after the ADP pipeline passes.
- **Pending:** decide whether the ignored FAB HDF5/NPZ reference data and ignored `Codes/` arrays/checkpoints need an external release artifact in addition to the mirror backup.
- **Pending:** integrate the completed JAX molecular backend into the paper only after BG sampling results pass the planned physical and distributional gates; then perform the final full-paper consistency audit.

## Timeline

### 2026-07-10T22:13:45-04:00 — Standalone recovery snapshot created

- Copied the complete project, including `.git`, untracked data, and ignored research artifacts, to `/mnt/backup/X-regularization_100726`.
- Verified matching source/snapshot HEAD, `git fsck --full --no-dangling`, equal payload inventories, and a checksum-clean `rsync` comparison.

### 2026-07-10T22:16:00-04:00 — JAX numerical tests adopted

- Copied `/mnt/projects/jflows/Codes` into the project as `Codes/` with matching checksums, 110 files, and 2,574,939,484 bytes.
- Confirmed the copied drivers use public `jflows` modules and contain no `zflows` imports.
- Added `*.eqx` to `.gitignore` so large Equinox checkpoints stay local.

### 2026-07-10T22:25:57-04:00 — Paper Section 5 synchronized

- Rewrote only Section 5 of `Paper_Arxiv/main.tex` from the new 2D, product multi-well, tilted φ⁴, and clock-model results.
- Copied the eight required figures from `Codes/` into `Paper_Arxiv/figures/` and verified their checksums.
- Preserved the molecular section and all earlier manuscript sections during the main synchronization pass.

### 2026-07-10T22:47:39-04:00 — Numerical presentation finalized and PDF rebuilt

- Refined headings, method names, table bolding, the complete clock per-rung table, propagation-factor and occupancy-bias definitions, figure sizing, and unavailable-rung notation.
- Method rows in the clock comparison use the explicit loss `KL + X_μ + X_(μ̂ + ν̄)/2` rather than “X-regularized.”
- Rebuilt `Paper_Arxiv/main.pdf`: 34 pages with resolved references and no reported layout warnings.

### 2026-07-10T22:56:28-04:00 — Migration checkpoint committed and pushed

- Committed 257 changed paths as `e6e8094e4290bbbf13609d4c8fb24b3475d10dd1` (`Migrate numerical experiments to jflows`): 125 additions, 129 deletions, 3 modifications, and one exact rename.
- Pushed `main` to `xuda-ye-math/X-regularization` using GitHub CLI authentication and verified the remote branch hash through the GitHub API.
- Left ignored `*.eqx`, `*.npz`, checkpoint, log, and bytecode artifacts out of Git; the pre-commit mirror at `/mnt/backup/projects/X-regularization` contains the local project state.

### 2026-07-10T23:19:48-04:00 — Fisher–Rao supplement merged into the manuscript

- Appended the Fisher–Rao gradient-flow derivations, convergence proof, and biased-target accuracy analysis to `Paper_Arxiv/main.tex` as Appendix A, titled “Fisher–Rao gradient flow with log-ratio variation.”
- Updated Section 2 and the organization paragraph to distinguish the main-text result summary from the appendix proofs; removed the obsolete cross-document reference setup and retired `Paper_Arxiv/supp.tex` and `Paper_Arxiv/supp.pdf`.
- Rebuilt `Paper_Arxiv/main.pdf`: 39 pages and 7,895,229 bytes, with resolved references and no reported overfull or underfull boxes.

### 2026-07-10T23:37:22-04:00 — Sections 1--4 evidence and consistency pass

- Reframed the headline result into two evidence-bounded regimes: the intended robustness for small or imperfect batches, and a clock-specific aggregate advantage through the largest tested batch, with the late-stage reversal at `B=125` stated explicitly.
- Independent terminology, mathematical, and editorial audits checked method names, stage/step language, map directions, theorem assumptions, empirical claims, and consistency with `Codes/style.md` and the result files.
- Corrected the training-sampler description: the implemented score-free annealing produces a biased target surrogate and is not exact AIS/SMC because rejuvenation targets the final distribution. Tightened the Fisher–Rao positivity statement and accuracy theorem to `λ < 1/2`.
- Replaced QT diffusion scale `σ_QT` by melt scale `m_e`; removed molecular-result framing from the abstract, organization, and Sections 1--4; rebuilt and visually inspected the 39-page PDF with no unresolved references or reported layout warnings.
- Preserved the user's deletion of all 47 tracked files under the obsolete root `2D_Benchmark/`; `Codes/2D_Benchmark/` remains the canonical numerical-test location.

### 2026-07-11T00:18:07-04:00 — Molecular workspaces audited and clean OpenMM rebuild started

- Classified `Molecular_BG_1/` as the preserved original PyTorch/paper-era result tree. Its ADP result is not a trustworthy physical benchmark because it used the wrong topology/force-field lineage, vacuum rather than OBC implicit solvent, and reports full-target ESS `0.000`.
- Classified `Molecular_BG_2/` as the paused PyTorch repair attempt and preserved its self-contained `zflows_md/` package as a useful read-only molecular reference parallel to jflows. Its OpenMM MD reference and OBC validation were useful, but the replacement ASMC ensemble remained incorrect and active PyTorch development has been abandoned in favor of jflows.
- Made `Molecular_BG/` the canonical active workspace. Copied the exact FAB ground-truth panel from `arXiv-2208.01893v3.tar.gz` (SHA-256 `b53d6bc8607672f48e4347f93593345b8e81a05027dd514be5ba63e5581cf7d9`), recorded its provenance, and added a tested 100 x 100 log-density replotter.
- Created and CUDA-smoke-tested a restartable OpenMM replica-exchange benchmark using Amber96 + OBC, L-alanine coordinates, and the `jflows` Conda environment. Installed Matplotlib and SciPy into that environment. The live checkpoint is ignored by Git but contains all sampled angles and replica state needed for replotting and continuation.
- Completed the initial 0.5 ns-per-replica CUDA run in 152.6 s. The 12-replica ladder maintained adjacent exchange acceptance between `0.632` and `0.722`; the saved 300 K samples cover several expected negative-phi basins and include a small positive-phi population. Rendered `Molecular_BG/adp_remd_ramachandran.png` directly from the checkpoint, establishing the requested basic OpenMM mode benchmark while leaving convergence as pending work.

### 2026-07-11T07:53:02-04:00 — Reliable two-chain ADP REMD benchmark completed

- Matched the FAB data-generation protocol with two independent OpenMM chains: 21 replicas from 300 to 1300 K, Amber96/OBC, unconstrained 1 fs Langevin dynamics, exchanges every 200 steps, and 300 K samples every 1000 steps. Each chain reached 20 ns per slot in two restartable segments; all four production segments completed below two hours.
- Saved 18,000 strictly post-burn-in frames per chain. At 36 bins, cross-chain JS divergence is `0.01229` bits and per-chain divergence to the authors' one-million-frame Zenodo training data is `0.01104`/`0.01172` bits. All 21 walkers in both chains traversed the complete ladder.
- Regenerated the final FAB and OpenMM 100-bin figures solely from saved angle arrays, using identical one-bin periodic smoothing and the same fixed `1e-4`--`1` logarithmic color range. Independent visual review rated the result 8/10 and supports the claim that its orientation and dominant modes visibly resemble FAB; rare positive-phi fine structure remains qualified as sampling-limited.
- Preserved the original FAB panel from the arXiv source archive and downloaded the authors' `train.h5` from Zenodo record 6993124, verifying MD5 `8d34fdda8694ee8d6745fc45b9eb3380`; MDTraj 1.11.1 generated the compact phi/psi reference array.

### 2026-07-11T12:02:51-04:00 — Exact FAB model audited and `jflows_md` design frozen

- Corrected the target identity after independent source and numerical audits: FAB uses ff96 + OBC1 (`igb=2`), while the completed local REMD chains use `amber96_obc.xml` OBC2. The local OBC2 result remains a close and reproducible comparison but is no longer described as the exact FAB Hamiltonian.
- Verified a PDB-built `amber96.xml + implicit/obc1.xml` OpenMM system against the canonical OpenMMTools ff96/OBC1 system on 100 FAB frames: maximum energy difference `1.90e-4 kJ/mol` and force RMSE `1.21e-3 kJ/mol/nm`.
- Verified the complete million-frame FAB split is L-alanine by an invariant signed-volume test, with zero D or planar frames. Confirmed the shipped topology PDB coordinates are D and the saved minimum is L, so the implementation plan requires a corrected canonical L PDB.
- Wrote `Molecular_BG/JFLOWS_MD_PLAN.md`: bundle-driven pure-JAX `Molecular_Potential`, exact OBC1/ACE energy, log-bond/logit-angle BAT coordinates, smooth ADP L half-chart, mixed spline flow on molecule-specific `R^p x T^q`, torus-correct MALA, potential-space SMC, forward KL + X, finite-safe optimizer-only `e_clip`, and explicitly no sharpening.
- Retained `Molecular_BG/adp_fab.png` as a fresh raw histogram of exactly 1,000,000 FAB ground-truth configurations with no KDE; removed the exploratory ADP PNG variants as requested.
- Refined the proposed facade to the project naming convention, `Molecular_Potential.from_bundle(...)`: a public benchmark bundle must carry topology, a complete serialized Hamiltonian, temperature, units, atom map, provenance, and hashes; trajectory coordinates remain independent validation data. Froze a three-target matrix: exact FAB L-ADP (60D), glycerol (36D), and the archived neutral diethanolamine microstate (48D). Audited the two archived small-molecule inputs as OpenFF 2.1.0/AM1-BCC vacuum systems without validated OBC1 parameters, so each new implicit-solvent target requires its own explicit GAFF2/AM1-BCC/OBC1 bundle and matched reference.
- Iterated the revised plan through independent force-field, chirality/domain, and architecture reviews. After incorporating a hash-bound `CoordinateSpec`, exact AmberTools/GAFF2 build artifacts, full small-molecule parity support, target-specific reference/gate criteria, wrapped-normal accuracy, and honest unclipped ESS, all three reviewers returned `PASS — no main issues` on round two.

### 2026-07-11T14:13:38-04:00 — `jflows_md` molecular core completed

- Added the companion `Molecular_BG/jflows_md/` package without modifying the copied base `jflows` source. Public APIs remain at package level and force-field, coordinate, chirality, validation, and builder internals live under `jflows_md/core/`.
- Implemented a bundle-driven, unsharpened `Molecular_Potential` with pure-JAX Amber/OBC1/ACE energy and exact internal-coordinate Jacobian. ADP uses an L-only half-chart; glycerol and neutral diethanolamine retain full parity support.
- Built and hash-bound three runtime targets: 60D ff96/OBC1 ADP, 36D GAFF2/AM1-BCC/OBC1 glycerol, and 48D GAFF2/AM1-BCC/OBC1 neutral diethanolamine. The relocated bundle builder reproduced all 25 scientific payload files byte-for-byte using only bundle-contained seeds.
- Added mixed-domain source sampling, torus-correct MALA, potential-space SMC, an identity flow baseline, and smoke tests. The full GPU suite passed with maximum OpenMM/JAX energy discrepancy `5.04e-8 kJ/mol` and maximum force RMSE `4.48e-8 kJ/mol/nm`.
- Minimized `Molecular_BG/` to packages, bundles, smoke tests, root documentation, and the standalone FAB reference folder. Renamed the reference figure to `reference/adp_truth.png`; the original HDF5 and derived NPZ remain local, ignored, and mirror-backed.
